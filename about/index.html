        Hi!  My name is Nellie Harden!<br/><br/>
        In a nutshell, I guess you could say I am a simple girl, living in a complicated world, who lives to love and serve others in any way I know how.  Through my nearly 4 decades that has changed faces time and time again.  But, it all comes back to “how can I help you?” and I am greatly humbled by the fact that I have been able to found a career based entirely on that very question.<br/><br/>
        I was an ocean dwelling soul born and raised in the middle of Michigan.  Yes, I do the mitten thing without thinking twice.  Knowing I wanted to get out to the ocean I focused and graduated with a degree in biology and animal behavior from Indiana University, moved out to North Carolina where my new husband and I were hoping to stay.  But, life called us back to the Midwest where I worked in aquariums and zoos and then settled into veterinary work when the schedule proved too unpredictable and we wanted a family.<br/><br/>
        We had 4 daughters in 4.5 years between Aril of 2005 and October of 2009.  It was a fast paced, crazy, awesome, exhausting, brutal and joyous time.  It all came to an abrupt fork in the road with a visit to the hospital and a diagnosis we didn’t see coming.  That night in December 2008 changed everything.  You can read about the birth of this practice in the blog posted here, in <a href="/blog/a-story-behind-a-mission/">A Story Behind a Mission</a> .<br/><br/>
        After bouncing around from Chicago to a few places around Indianapolis we found our way back to the place that had been our refuge, our heart fill station, our special place for nearly 2 decades.  Southport, NC is not called the “happiest seaside town” for nothing and though we moved here in 2015, we really had always been here.  We live in our place by the sea, raising our four amazing daughters and taking in each day while I keep so very busy with serving, teaching homeschool, writing, reading and working the mission that has been put before me to help others in many wellness capacities so we can all be free to live the life we design.  I love walks on my favorite seaside street, playing with my kids and husband and just being.  My winding road has lead me to become a certified health coach and you want to know one of my favorite thing to do?  Connect.  I love to connect and get to know your story.  We all have a story to share.  I hope I can hear yours and I would love to help you in whatever way I can.
